# HTTPWaveRider

This is a simple HTTP server built in Java 8 that demonstrates how to handle incoming TCP connections and process HTTP 
requests and responses. The server uses the ServerSocket and Socket classes to manage the TCP connections , and can 
handle multiple clients simultaneously by creating a new thread for each connection.

## Description

The server is designed to be a learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of networking and web development, 
and can be expanded upon to support more advanced features and functionality. It includes basic support for parsing 
HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses, as well as error handling and socket management.
